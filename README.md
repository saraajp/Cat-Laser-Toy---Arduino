# Cat-Laser-Toy---Arduino

Material used: 
- two microservos
- two potentiometers
- one Arduino Uno
- one breadbord
- one laser
- wires
- some tape


In this project we are able to move a laser in both X and Y axis.
We stack a microservo on top of the other, and finaly the laser on the top of both of them
Each microservo will have a potentiometer assign to it
  - One will control the X axis and the other the Y axis
  - We'll use the potentiometers to control the movements

Last but now less important, use it to play with your cat :)
